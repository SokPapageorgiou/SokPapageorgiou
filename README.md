### 👽🧩 Hello there, Sokratis here! 

After a very intense time learning the SOLID principles and Design Patterns, I've got myself trapped into AI's rabbit hole. Been mesmerized by Decision Trees, State Machines, Pathfinders, Procedural Content Generation.

My goal is to not be Engine dependent and be able to write in both C++ and C#. Unity API is no stranger to me, Unreal API is making a good progress into my brain and I am pretty open to learn another Engine, if necessary.
