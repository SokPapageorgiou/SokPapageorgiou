### 👽🧩 Hello there, Sokratis here! 

The Covid-19 pandemic made me decide to change the paths of my career.  Game Development started as a hobby and without me realizing it I was reading books about Agile principles and Clean Code.
It became an obsession and now I am studying Game Programming at the Försbergsskola in Sweden to level up my skills.
Unity and C# are no strangers to me, also I am learning Unreal and C++.
